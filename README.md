###*An experimental modular MMO server emulator.*
---
Ember is an educational server emulation project targeting the WoW 1.12.1 protocol, striving to be a modular and robust architecture.

###Project aims:
- Offer a broad range of activities for contributors to develop their skills in.
- A focus on code quality and robustness over features.
- A modular architecture in contrast with the monolithic architectures of similar projects.

###Supported platforms:
Ember aims to support the following platforms as a minimum:

| Operating System  | Architectures  |
| :------------ |:---------------:|
| Linux      | x86, x64, ARMv6 (tentative) |
| Windows       | x86, x64        |
| Mac OS | x86, x64        |

###Compiler support:
This table lists the compilers that Ember actively supports as well as the minimum versions capable of compiling the codebase. Only the supported versions are guaranteed to work.

|       |  Supported  |   Minimum   |
|-------|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| MSVC  | 19 (VS2015) | 19 (VS2015) |
| Clang |     3.7     |     3.4     |
| GCC   |     5.1     |     5.0     |

###Contributing:
Contributors are always welcome. If you seek to get your hands dirty, take a peek at 'docs/Contributing.md' for advice on getting started.

###Why WoW 1.12.1?
Our primary goal isn't to produce a feature-complete, up-to-date emulator to use with newer clients. The 1.12.1 protocol was chosen as a fixed target to leverage the extensive research of prior projects, allowing for greater focus on writing code over reverse engineering.
